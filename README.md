Completed Homework for GoodData

### Dev/Tested environment
OS: MacOS 10.14.6  
Node: 12.14.1  
Yarn: 1.X  

### Initialization
1. Make a [fork of this repository and clone it](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo).
2. Run `cd GoodData-HW`.
3. Run `yarn install`.
4. Run `yarn start`.
5. Visit https://localhost:3000/account.html, and log in using your GoodData account credentials.
   - If you do not have a GoodData account yet, [create one](https://gooddata-examples.herokuapp.com/registration). After creating a GoodData account, you will be redirected to our GoodData.UI Live Examples. Feel free to get inspired there, but its not related to this homework.
6. Visit https://localhost:3000/, and make sure that two column charts are loaded like this:

### Task

__Make the dropdown work. That is, the dropdown `onChange` should reload the upper chart appropriately.__
